	<p class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	This is version 1.0 of the IIS-UK privacy policy published on 01 Aug 2018.
	</p>
	  
	<p class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	The International Isotope Society UK Group (IIS-UK) has issued the following privacy policy in line with new GDPR regulations which came into effect on 25 May 2018. In summary, IIS-UK must:
	</p>
	
	<p class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
		<ul class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
			<li>Have legitimate interests for collecting and using your personal information.</li>
			<li>Not use your personal information in ways that may adversely affect you.</li>
			<li>Be transparent about how we intend to use your personal information.</li>
			<li>Provide you with appropriate privacy notices when collecting your personal information.</li>
			<li>Provide a simple method for you to update your information or have it deleted.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	IIS-UK takes data privacy responsibilities seriously and we want you to understand and feel confident about how we collect, use and safeguard your personal information when you engage with us via email, the IIS-UK website (https://www.iis-uk.org), in person or by other means. This policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.
	</p> 

	<h2 class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	1. What Information Do We Collect?
	</h2>
	
	<p class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	In the course of our activities, IIS-UK may collect, store and use a limited amount of your personal information for legitimate purposes to promote upcoming IIS-UK events via direct email marketing and to provide information concerning those events to delegates. The information we hold is purposefully limited to the type of information that can be found on a typical business card: first name, last name, employer (organisation/company name), work email address and in some cases a work phone number and postal address. In certain circumstances it is possible that IIS-UK may hold other information about you necessary to fulfil its obligations and provide services to you during events such as special dietary requirements and other organisational information. You will be asked to provide this information if/when the need arises.
	</p>
	
	<h2 class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	2. Cookies, Tracking & Website Traffic
	</h2>
	
	<p class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	IIS-UK does not currently use cookies or any other method to track visitors to our website at https://www.iis-uk.org although our use of embedded third-party forms to collect registration information may use of cookies of their own. We currently see no need to track our visitors and have chosen to respect your privacy. Should things change in the future we will update this privacy policy and privacy policy notices will be displayed the first time users visit the website after the update.
	</p>
	
	<p class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	The IIS-UK website (<a href="https://www.iis-uk.org">https://www.iis-uk.org</a>) is accessible over TLS (Transport Layer Security, the successor to Secure Sockets Layer or SSL). All data sent between the server and client (website visitor) is encrypted using a certificate issued by the Letâ€™s Encrypt Authority. Certificates are valid for ~90 days after which time the existing certificate is revoked and a new one issued automatically. Any third party services used to collect information via forms have been chosen because they conform to similar standards of encryption to protect your information in transit over the internet. It is expected that your ISP (or DNS or VPN provider) will be able to tell that you visited the IIS-UK website but cannot tell which pages you viewed or intercept any information that you send back while data transfer is encrypted.
	</p>
	
	<h2 class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	3. Using Your Personal Data
	</h2>
	
	<p class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	We may hold a limited amount of your personal information in order to communicate with you by email (or in rare cases by telephone or post) for the purpose of promoting IIS-UK events or to provide you with delegate information once you have registered to attend an event and fulfil our obligations to you as a delegate. We do this because we believe that you are genuinely interested in being informed about our events and that we have a legitimate interest in contacting you.
	</p>
	
	
	<h2 class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	4. Disclosure
	</h2>
	
	<p class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	IIS-UK may share personal information with conference facility vendors for the purpose of providing delegates with hospitality at events we organise. IIS-UK will not sell, share or otherwise disclose your personal information to any other third parties unless you have granted us permission to do so or unless we are required to do so by law.
	</p>
	
	<p class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	If you consent that we may share your personal information with third parties then we will only share your information with event sponsors. These are typically companies that you may have existing relationships with, whose products or services you are likely to be interested in and with whom you have had the opportunity to interact with in person at IIS-UK events.
	</p>
	
	
	<h2 class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	5. Security of Your Personal Data
	</h2>
	
	<p class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	We will take all reasonable precautions to prevent the loss, misuse, alteration or accidental disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy. Personal information will not be stored in a publically accessible way. Access will be controlled and data stored in a limited number of locations, either under the direct control of members of the organising committee during processing or using a cloud service offering secure storage/access such that information is encrypted during transfer over the internet and where possible, encrypted at rest.
	</p>
	
	<p class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	The security of information provided to us through insecure means (e.g. in the clear via email) cannot be guaranteed however once we have received your information we will use the methods described above to safeguard against further disclosure.
	</p>
	
	
	<h2 class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	6. Policy Amendments & Transparency
	</h2>
	
	<p class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	IIS-UK may update this privacy policy document (and the publically accessible copy published at <a href="https://www.iis-uk.org/privacy">https://www.iis-uk.org/privacy</a>) from time-to-time and without prior notice. The date of publication will be clearly displayed and a summary of changes from the previous version may also be included. Delegates at IIS-UK events and visitors to the IIS-UK website are encouraged to check this policy periodically to ensure you are familiar and satisfied with any changes.
	</p>
	
	
	<h2 class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">

		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	IIS-UK must comply with all requests within 1 calendar month of receipt although we will endeavour to manage requests more swiftly.
	</p>
	
	
	<h2 class="col-9-desktop col-8-hd no-float center-element">
	8. Third Party Websites
